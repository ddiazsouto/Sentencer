# Sentencer
<p>Sentencer is an ice breaker</p>
<p>It populates databases</p>
<p>Rocks parties</p>
<p>And sometimes generates sentences</p>
<p><i>It is so user friendly that needs no explanation</i></p>
<br><br>

## --Requirements
<br>
The modules used by python are

<u>flask   </u>       - to render the main frame of the app  <br>
<u>requests </u>   - for services to interact through GET and POST requests   <br>
<u>pymysql  </u>   - personal choice to interact with the database   <br>

The following modules have been using for testing:

<u>mock </u>          <br>
<u>flask_testing </u> <br>
<u>pytest     </u>    <br>
<u>pytest-cov   </u>  <br>

<br>

## --Test Analysis
<br><p>

#### I have followed a TDD approach in building my aplication, which saved plenty of time in finding errors without having to manually load the app. Testing has been done in the following areas:
</p>
<br>

#### <p>I started testing that the pages could load and thus we would get a return statement with a status of 200 from the get request.</p>

#### <p>Then more thorough testing was applied to logic of Service 4 achieving a 96% coverage with 5 tests</p>
<br>

#### <p>Posteriorly, the logic on Services 2 and 3 was more thoroughly tested achieving a coverage of 97-98% with 5 tests</p>
<br>


####  <p>Service 4 Has used mock in the testing, this helps to check that the json is parsed propperly by the page and that is can be used propperly by the page logic. 3 tests achieved 94% coverage</p>
<br>

#### <p>At last, Service 1, as it has some more requirements like interaction with the database needed extra testing, 94% coverage was achieved with 5 tests </p>


<br>

## --Tech Stack used
<br>
<p>
A MySQL database running in GCP for the app to connect <br>
Infrastructure of the app will be in Python<br>
Git as VSC<br>
A fully integrated pipeline using Jenkins<br>
Ansible as Configuration Manager<br>
The cloud provider of choice was GCP<br>
The containerization tool used was Docker, orchestrated with Docker Swarm<br>
Further automation was achieved with docker-compose<br>
nginx has served both as a reverse proxy and a load balancer<br>

## --Database
The DataBase has been a simple flat database that stores the sentences most liked by the users, this can be used to improve the release of new features, implementation of more vocabulary, etc.
<br>


## --Software Architecture
<br>
Sentencer is a Microserviced aplication. Each container does one thing and it does it very well.
<br><br><p>
Container 2, generates a json containing a random selection of parts of a sentence, a boolean statement to define whether the sentence is a question or a statement and a boolean value for darkness of a color later generated (will the color be dark or not dark)</p>
<p>
Container 3, generates a random expression, dependin whether the mood is 1 for happy or 0 for sad and passes the mood together with the expression in json so the color that is generated posteriorly will take the mood into acount.</p>
<p>
Container 4, grabs the information from container 2 and 3 and does some logic to put together a sentence that can have positive or negative connotation depending on the value for mood and that it can be asking or answering. The json generated by container 4 will also contain a hexagesimal value for the background color that takes into account the tone  and the darkness defined in container 2 and 3. </p>
<p>
Container 1, being the frontend, displays a random sentence based in the parameters above and a background color which will change accordingly of the mood of the sentence.

<br><p>The information flows between containers following this flowchart:</p><br>

## --CI/CD pipeline
<br>
The pipeline is automated with a Webhook from githum and integrated using a Jenkinsfile, from there we use docker commands, docker-compose for a unified configuration, docker swarm for deployment and Ansible for configuration management.<br>
<p>
It follows this steps:</p>

| Description |Evaluation| Likelihood  | Impact Level | Responsability |  Response  |  Control Measures  
| :---        | :----:   |  :----:     |  :----:      |  :----:        |  :----:    |---:
| The project is missing basic functionality on the day of the project | I had issues with connecting containers, machines or deploying| Medium  | Critical | Mine |    |  Work on the basic foundation of the app early on and build on top 
|The app behaves differntly after integration than in development environment |	The project gives new problems| Medium/high |	Very High | me	| Undo last changes and detect the issue before deploying |	There should be a CI pipeline before the app has any new features or any features at all so we can integrate frequently with Jenkins and be able to detect problematic changes as they happen rather than a bunch at the time
|The aplication code has bugs when pushed|	The developer didn't realise mistakes in coding and has pushed to a CD pipeline| Moderate |	Very High | me or collaborators	| Propper response should be as automated as possible |	The first stage in the Jenkins Pipeline perform tests wo we find the issues early on and way before building any changes or deploying them
| The connection between elements of the app falls down | the configuration that previously worked is no longer holding the app together | Medium/Low  | High | VM/Docker images/Jenkins pipelina |  Use a redundant Microservices aplication allocated for this purpose  |  Create a Redundant application as a back up
|The Microserviced app is not finished on time|	Issues when deploying at the end| Moderate |	Very High | me/project manager	| Show the finished bits |	Have a working pipeline and infrastructure early on so we can test as we deploy (CI)
|There are problems in a local network i.e. US west|	GCP network system is down| Extremely low |	Very High | GCP	| Make sure load balancers are redirecting traffic to other regions |	Create part of the Swarm in different zones
|Last changes in the source code make app unstable| Source code has changed	| Moderate |    Very High | Me and/or collaborators	| Git Revert to last stable release|	Make sure CVS has been used propperly during development
| Current configuration is unstable |There was some manual change that affected how the swarm behaves| Relatively unlikely  | High | Mine |  Thanks to Ansible we can create a whole new swarm in very little time, matter of minutes. We can create a redundant configuration in a different zone  |  Another machine is running with Jenkins and Ansible installed as well as docker and docker compose
